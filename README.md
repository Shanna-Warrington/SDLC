How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
By getting feedback from suctomers and stakeholders the product owner and team are able to get an idea of what the public wants to see in the product. When we gathe user stories and sort them by size and priority we are better able to work them into the sprints and incorporate the changes that they bring with them into the product.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
Before this point I approached developing programs in a waterfall method. I started at the front and worked my way thru, never diverting from the path. With the introduction of agile, I believe going forward I will break up the work into sprints and be better able to handle changes during the work better. I hope that any team I join will be albe to incorporate some agile practices such as daily scrum meetings, being self organizing and more independent from micromanaging.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member means going back to the basic lessons of childhood. As children we were taught to share and be kind. That can still be applied to working with a team for a job. Just because you wrote some code doesn't mean that someone else can not go over it and make changes. It means collaborating and helping each other out as a team, not as an individual. Being kind to others can really help the work flow smoother and help get things done efficiently. It does no good being terrible to others.
